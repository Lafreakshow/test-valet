# Note: I would have preferred to use Gradle 6.1.1 but apparently it has a bug that causes it to force any kotlin build
# to run with an older 1.3 version of kotlin.reflect. Setting the kotlin Language level to 1.3 fixes the problem from
# it but I'd rather avoid any further difficult to debug issues for now.
