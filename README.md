# Test Navigator *Renavigated*

This is a continuation/extension/rework of the [Test Navigator IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/stacherzakp/test-navigator-plugin)

I originally just wanted to make some quick changes, but it became apparent very quickly that it would turn into a
 major effort. So major, the version you see now probably has nothing in common with the original plugin anymore
 except for some features. However, I started out with the original code, so I found it appropriate to credit
 the original author.
   
As of writing this, the repository contains the original icons from Test Navigator, which I assume where made by the
 Author. Test Navigator is licenses under Apache 2.0, and so I hope that using them is no problem. At some point
 before version 1.0 (or immediately, should the Author of these icons ask so), I plan to replace them with something
 custom-made. 

Since I have very little experience with creating icons, any contribution of them would be appreciated
. My only hard requirement is that the final Icons are free to redistribute and reuse in different projects by
 anyone who happens to find them. Me being unclear about the licensing of the original icons is the only reason why I
 seek to replace them.
 
NOTE: WHATEVER TERMS THE AUTHOR SET FOR THE ORIGINAL ICONS APPLY TO THE COPIES IN THIS REPO. They are not meant to
 redistributed as part of the final plugin and if you read this, then it is likely in the commit history a good while
 after the version 1.0. In this case and if you intend to use this version then I only ask that if they are still
 in the repository at this point, you replace them with whatever I used as their replacement in future versions. If you
 happen to be the Authors lawyer, I can only hope that we can come to an agreement in private. I have no interest in
 violating anyone's copyright and will comply as soon as it is humanly possible for me.
